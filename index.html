	<h1>Hacking cheap fitness trackers</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Looking for a smartwatch to display custom information I first thought about the offerings using iOS/Android Wear, but since the Apple watch is so 'fugly' (and I dont use an Apple phone) that was out. The Android offerings where all really big (I'm really skinny, so they look silly on me!) also since I will require the watch to work with Bluetooth in Central(Client/Scanning) mode that Im not sure what models would support and the fact that they are pretty expensive put me off even attempting to build anything on these systems.</p>
<p>Then I found out about these cheap fitness trackers, they are available in a wide range of designs - round faces, sports bands, fugly Apple watch style. They can be bought from the usual suppliers of cheap electronics for under £10 delivered! And are typically equipped with a micro controller as main processor, small OLED screen, a 3 axis accelerometer and optical heartrate sensor. depending on the watch you might even get a temperature, atmospheric pressure or ECG sensor.</p>
<p>A bit of internet digging reveals some activity centered around hacking these devices, mostly targeting the ones using Nordic's nRF5x family of uController chips. Since I have used Nordic's nRF5x chips before I also specifically looked for watches that said they contained them as the main processor, I have now discovered that <strong>the fact that it might say it uses a particular chip is no guarantee that it does actually contain that part!</strong><br/>
So far I have bought 3 different models - ID107, ID107HR Plus and an ID115HR ?? 2018 <br />
Below is a quick overview of each watch.

    This was the first watch I bought, mainly I got this as it had been covered by Roger Cark and hence had working code available, as well as having a screwed on back cover for easy access.
    <br />My only real issue is the screen size, it does not look as small in the promotional images because
    of the black face, if you look at the internal photos you will get a better idea of its size (btw - it's 64px*32px)<br />
	What is very usefull with this watch is the previous work done by the likes of Roger and ?? Their work together  provides sample code that demonstrates the use of all the periperals available on the device - i.e. the buttons, vibration motor, screen, HR sensor and accelerometer (The code is done on the Arduino platform and utilises Sandeep Mistry's Arduino core for nRf5x SDK).<br />
I also have code available on GitHub for this device (a simple watch that displays blood gloucose levels from the LimiTTer device) it is coded Directly using Nordic's SDK10, compliled with GCC and was uploaded using a STM32 Blue Pill clone running the Black Magic Probe firmware (via xyz).
However after a while (and a coffe spillage incedent!) I began having a problem where the screen would only come on when it was connected to a 5V power source.. at this point I decided to cut my losses and move over to the ID115HR that had been laying open on my desk for weeks.

    After playing ith the ID107 for a while and realising that the screen was just to small to be happy with. and I started having issus where the screen would only work if connected to a 5v power sourceI had this watch laying open on my desk for a good while so decided to

    When I was looking for a replacment for my broken ID115HR I found this watch listed for ~£7(UK), the listing said it had an nRF uC so I got one on implulse.
